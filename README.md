# Pig Game

A game made with the help of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
In this game, two players roll a dice, and accumulate scores for them. Scores have to be held for them to be counted as points. Scores not held will not be added, and a player will lose all score accumulated if they roll a '1'. First player to score 100 points will be the winner.

This project has used DOM manipulation, handling events and Arrays as tools.
